# Shopping list
Part of The Odin Project JS foundations course. Built as per task requirements, with additional functionality.

## How it's made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Experimented with event listeners, the `Date()` method, and appending multiple elements to a child element before displaying.

I also used an event callback in this project to access the event itself within the `addItem()` function.

## Optimisation and improvements
I added the current date to the shopping item, probably not useful for users building quick shopping lists, more to learn how to do it.

Converted the input and button into an HTML form so that users can use the enter key to add items. I then had to use `preventDefault()` to stop the automatic page refresh on form submit.

## Things I would like to add
- Split into separate JS and CSS files (I was lazy this time)
- Better CSS styling
- Local storage
